# CHEM371-LW-QuantumChemistryLab

Welcome to the github repository of CHEM371-LW Quantum Chemistry Lab!

This is an introductory class on quantum chemistry. It covers practical aspects of computational quantum chemistry and writing. This course is being taught in the Fall of 2020 so new material will appear as we move along the semester.

This repository collects:
- The notes from this class. PDF files for the chapters can be found in the [pdfs folder](pdfs). These notes are typed in XeLaTeX and are freely available for anyone to download and use (under a Creative Commons license). 
- The notebooks used in class to introduce students to psi4. These can be found in [the Notebooks folder](Notebooks). If you have psi4 installed you can practice along doing these computations.
