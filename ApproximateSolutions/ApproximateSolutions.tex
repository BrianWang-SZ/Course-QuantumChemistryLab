\chapter{Solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for one-electron systems}

The goal of this chapter is to discuss how we can practically solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a computer.
We will encounter the idea of using a basis of functions (basis set) to find approximate solutions that can be systematically improved.
Lastly, we will look at some applications of these ideas.

\section{Exact solutions to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation}
Only for a handful of models relevant to chemistry we know how to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
Some examples are a particle in a box, a particle attached to a spring (harmonic oscillator), a rotating body, any atom with one electron, and the \ce{H2+} molecule.
For example, the hydrogen atom solutions are known to depend on three quantum numbers $n$, $l$, and $m_l$, and that the energy levels (eigenvalues) are given by
\begin{iequation}
E_n = - \frac{1}{2 n^2}  \, E_\mathrm{h}, \quad n = 1, 2, \ldots
\end{iequation}
The wave function is usually expressed in \emph{spherical coordinates} ($r, \theta, \phi$)\mnote{
If you are curious, spherical coordinates are connected to Cartesian coordinates via the following equations
\begin{align*}
x & =  r \sin \theta \cos \phi, \\
y & =  r \sin \theta \sin \phi, \\
z & =  r \cos \theta
\end{align*}

}
 as a product of a function that depends on the electron distance $R_{nl}(r)$ and a term that depends on the angles $Y_l^{m_l}(\theta,\phi)$
\begin{equation}
\psi_{nlm_l}(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{nl}(r) Y_l^{m_l}(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}
For example, the wave function for the  ground state of hydrogen, the 1s orbital, is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{1s} = \psi_{1,0,0}(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{1,0}(r) Y_0^0(\theta,\phi) = 2 e^{-r} \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-r}
\end{equation}
while the 2p$_{z}$ orbital is given by
\begin{align}
\mathrm{2p}_{z} &= \psi_{2,1,0}(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{2,1}(r) Y_1^{0}(\theta,\phi) =
\frac{1}{4\sqrt{2 \pi}}   r e^{-r/2} \cos \theta.
\end{align}

When we turn to more complicated systems like atoms with two or more electrons and molecules the Schr\"{o}dinger equation becomes intractable and we have to turn to numerical methods to solve it.
This is what we will do in the next section.

\section{Approximate solutions via expansion in a basis}

One way to find an approximate solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is to express it as a \emph{linear combination of basis functions}.
This is a very common strategy for studying differential equations that are too difficult to solve in analytical form.
The basic idea is to approximate a function $g(x)$ as a sum of a finite number of fixed functions $f_i(x)$, called basis functions, multiplied by the coefficients $c_i$
\begin{equation}
g(x) \approx  c_1 f_1(x) +  c_2 f_2(x) + \cdots + c_K f_K(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{K} c_i f_i(x) 
\end{equation}
You can think of this approximation as fitting the function $g(x)$ with the basis functions, where the unknowns are the fitting coefficients $c_i$.
For example, we could choose the set of basis functions to be the polynomials of $x$ and stop at the polynomial of order $K$ (here we also include the constant term $x^0 = 1$)
\begin{equation}
g(x) \approx  c_0 +  c_1 x + \cdots + c_K x^{K} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} c_i x^{i-1}
\end{equation}
